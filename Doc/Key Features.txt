PURPOSE

Full Motion of a Ship on a Cinematic-Quality Ocean Simulation

PHILOSOPHY

No commercial or freeware 3D engine
Simulation written in C++ with Opengl, glfw, glad, glm, assimp, libigl,imgui, nanovg, stb, freeimage, eigen, fftw3, pugixml, nova, clipper
Real time simulation with high rate of frames per second (target of 150 fps in fullscreen 2560 x 1440)
The rendering of the 3D scene is optimized to ensure consistency of visual quality between all elements: ocean, ship, sky, clouds, terrain, mist or fog effects


OCEAN

Spectral wind wave model, based on Phillips spectrum
Dynamic PBR anisotropic BRDF
Foam simulation
Underwater view
Instanced patches defined by LOD settings
Host readbacks for in-game physics
Spectral analysis

WIND

Strength (1 to 30 knots) and direction

SKY

Dynamic sky (physical atmosphere) with moving volumetric clouds, godrays and bloom
Sun positioned according to date and time (day and night)
Mist and Fog

SHIP

Full motion over 6 degrees of freedom (surge, sway, heave, yaw, pitch, roll)
Ship motion forces (archimede, gravity, viscous resistance, wave resistance, residual resistance, wind drift, wind rotation, thuster, bow thruster, rudder)
Propellers and radars animated
Reflection of the ship on the water
Wake simulation
Smoke simulated with particles
Navigation lights
Autopilot with Proportional-Integral-Derivative controller

ENVIRONMENT

Camera full smooth motion (orbital around the ship, fps, fixed views and free views on board the ship)
3D sounds (engines, seagulls, horn)
Terrain (island)
Markup (buoys)
